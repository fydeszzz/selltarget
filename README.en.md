# Sell Target — Know your exit before you enter.
![logo](public/logo.png)
~ Pick a stock · Set a goal · See the price you should sell at ~

## Features
- Sell-target calculation: enter price, shares, and a goal to get the exact sell price
- Two goal modes: target **% return** or target **$ profit**
- Live price fetch for **TW stocks** (TWSE MIS) and **US stocks** (Yahoo Finance)
- TW net-profit calculation: total cost - broker commission (optional 折數 multiplier) - securities transaction tax, with automatic ETF detection
- Commission-discount reverse calculator: enter what you paid, see the 折數 you actually got
- Bilingual UI (English / 繁體中文) with auto-detection and persistence

## Who It's For
- **Dollar-cost-averaging ETF savers** — set a "sell when profit hits the goal" target and let discipline, not emotion, time your exit.
- **Day traders / short-term traders** — instantly compute the sell price, commission, and transaction tax to stay strict on daily entries and exits.
- **Any TW / US investor who wants to know the exit before the entry** — one tap to the price you should sell at and your real net profit.

## Quick Start
On launch, the **賣點試算 (Sell-Target)** tab opens by default:

> Example: TSLA at `$415`, holding `10` shares, want `+10%` → sell at **`$456.50`**.

1. Pick a market (台股 / 美股), type a code or name, and press **取得 (Fetch)** to pull a live price.
2. Enter your average cost and how many shares you hold, then choose a goal mode (報酬率 % or 目標獲利 $).
3. The panel shows the **target sell price**, total cost/revenue, and profit; for TW it adds a full commission + tax breakdown with net profit.
